# Data-Warehousing-BI-Project
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence solution using SQL Server, SSAS, Excel, and Power BI.

🚀 Project Overview

The project focuses on building an end-to-end data warehouse system and applying OLAP analysis and data visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights.
Key steps included:
Designing and implementing a data warehouse schema (fact & dimension tables).
Creating an SSAS Cube with hierarchies and measures for multidimensional analysis.
Performing OLAP operations (Roll-up, Drill-down, Slice, Dice, Pivot) using Excel.
Building interactive Power BI dashboards for reporting and decision support.
